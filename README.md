# odin-recipes-2
In this second attempt of learning to become a web dev, I am creating a recipe simple website.

I want to practice:
 1. Cloning a repository, making changes, checking the status of git, committing the changes and pushing the changes.
 2. Using HTML to create a simple web page. (editing text, opening new pages and using links and images)
